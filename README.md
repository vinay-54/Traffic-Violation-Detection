# 🚦 Vehicle Detection & Red Light Violation System  

This project detects vehicles in a video stream and automatically flags **red light violations** using a YOLO-based object detection model. It processes traffic footage, identifies vehicles crossing the stop line during a red light, and saves cropped images of violating vehicles. It also provides a visual flash alert in the annotated video output. NOTE: This project is a prototype and only includes a sample video footage, however, real-time video can be sourced and used as the input to the existing project.

## 📌 Features  
- **Real-time Vehicle Detection** using a trained YOLO model (`best.pt`)  
- **Red Light Violation Detection** based on predefined signal timing  
- **Flashing Alert** for vehicles violating the stop line during red light  
- **Automatic Cropping & Saving** of violating vehicles’ images  
- **Annotated Output Video** showing bounding boxes, traffic light status, and violation count  
- **Customizable Parameters** for adapting to real-world conditions

## 🤖 Model & Training Reference

The YOLO model (`best.pt`) used in this project was trained using a dataset and preprocessing pipeline from **Roboflow**, originally created and shared by another contributor.  

**Original Roboflow Project:** [Vehicle Object Detection Model](https://app.roboflow.com/vehicle-object-detection-oyglk/vehicle_detection-rdah2-wvwbb/generate/preprocessing)  

All credit for the dataset and preprocessing configuration goes to the original creator. This repository only covers the detection, logging, and visualization implementation.



## ⚙️ Installation and Setup
1. **Clone this repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/vehicle-detection.git
cd vehicle-detection
```
2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy
```
3. Add the YOLO model weights
   Place your trained YOLO weights file (`best.pt`) in the project folder.
4. Add your video
   Replace `Video_final_4.mp4` with your own traffic video or rename accordingly.

## 🚀 Usage
Run the detection script:
```bash
python main.py
```
Press **Q** anytime to exit

## 🛠 Customization
**Change red light timing**
In `main.py`, modify the `is_red_light()` function:
```python
def is_red_light():
    current_pos_seconds = cap.get(cv.CAP_PROP_POS_MSEC) / 1000.0
    return current_pos_seconds > 12  # Change threshold for your video
```
Adjust frame skipping,
```python
frame_skip = 5  # Lower = smoother but slower
```
Modify stop line position:
```python
line_y = 310  # Change based on your camera angle
```
## 📊 Output
- `violations/` → Cropped images of violating vehicles
- `Annotated_Video.mp4` → Video with annotations and alerts
- Terminal logs → Shows when violations are detected

## 🖥 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Ultralytics YOLO
- OpenCV
- NumPy
